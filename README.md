# Amazon-Wishlists Scraper, v1.0

I have over 60 Amazon wishlists and in some lists sometimes 100 products, mainly books. 
I often buy used books and checking all current (2nd hand) prices is time consuming. 
This scraper exports _all_ lists to a XML-file, 
with the items filtered according to price, priority etc.


## This

## Requirements

- GNU/Linux operating system (other platforms not tested)
- Python 2.7.16

	`$ pip install scrapy`
	(pip is usally available in your package manager)

```


The scraper exports to `wishlist.xml`, which is generated based on:
- the filter rules in `settings.py` (MAXPRICE, EXCLUDES, MINPRIORITY etc)
- the old `wishlist.xml` (if exists) in order to identify changes

Modern web-browsers also layout the exported plain XML-file based on:
- the HTML document structure rules in `wishlist.xslt` (headings, sections, ...)
- the HTML document presentation rules in `wishlist.css` (colors, fonts, ...)

The `wishlist.xslt` currently declares the output document structure with:
- a section that only displays changes (newcomers)
- a section that only displays the most important items from all lists together
- multiple sections for all individual lists with their items

XSLT is a declarative, Turing-complete language for transforming 
XML documents into other XML documents (HTML in this case). 
XSLT runs queries against the XML-file and feeds the result into templates
with placeholders. 

CSS is a stylesheet language used to describe how elements should be rendered
on screen etc.

XML, XSLT and CSS are supported by modern web-browsers out of the box.

**Remarks:**

One could do the filtering through the XSLT-file too, 
but tracking changes wouldn't work properly anymore (with just 1 XML-file at least).
