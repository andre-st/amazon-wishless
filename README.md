# Amazon-Wishlists Export & Price-Monitor, v1.4.1

![Maintenance](https://img.shields.io/maintenance/yes/2019.svg)

I have over 60 Amazon wishlists and in some lists sometimes 100 products, mainly books. 
I often buy used books and checking all current, continuously changing 2nd hand prices 
against my budget is time consuming. 
This Amazon-wishlist scraper exports _all_ lists to a XML-file.
The XML-file is displayed with all items filtered and re-ordered according to price, priority etc.
[What's new?](CHANGELOG.md)


## Exported XML (web-browser view)

## Requirements

- tested on the GNU/Linux operating system but might work on everything which runs Scrapy
- Python 2.7.16
- Scrapy 1.7.3 (web crawling framework)
- lxml (XML library)
- pip (package installer for Python) to install dependencies 
  (pip is usually available in the package manager of your Linux distribution)


## Getting started

GNU/Linux terminal:

```console
$ pip install scrapy lxml   # Install dependencies
$ git clone https://github.com/andre-st/amazon-wishless
$ cd amazon-wishlist
$ mv settings.py-example settings.py
$ vi settings.py            # vi or any other editor

Edit your wishlists settings
Edit your localization settings

$ scrapy runspider wishlist.py
$ firefox wishlist.xml
```


## Observations and limitations

- requires _public_ wishlists
- the second hand price shown by Amazon may be low, but the final price is
  _sometimes_ realized on frivolously high shipping prices. 
  Shipping prices are currently not taken into account
- runtime is okay (53 long lists or 230 requests < 30 seconds), requests seem not throttled
- if many lists fail with "503 Service Unavailable" you need to 
  increase `SCRAPY_SETTIGNS.DOWNLOAD_DELAY` in settings.py



## Customization

```

XSLT is a declarative, Turing-complete language for transforming 
XML documents into other XML documents (XHTML in this case). 
XSLT runs queries against the XML-file and feeds the result into templates
with placeholders. The web-browser automatically loads and processes the XSLT and CSS files
for `wishlist.xml`. XML, XSLT and CSS are supported by modern web-browsers out of the box.

For your own XSLT-file just change the `WISHLISTS_XMLPATH` value in `settings.py`.
